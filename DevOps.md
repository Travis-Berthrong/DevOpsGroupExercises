DevOps promotes increased collaboration across teams, including developers, operations, and quality assurance. This collaboration helps to break down silos and improve communication, leading to faster delivery of software and more efficient problem-solving. This more holistic approach to the development process allows teams to identify and address bottlenecks and inefficiencies more effectively.
