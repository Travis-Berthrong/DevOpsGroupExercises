# GitHub Flow

Where Git Flow follows a strict branching hiegharchy with a master branch and a develop branch, GitHub Flow is a more lightweight approach to branching. GitHub Flow is a single branch model that uses feature branches for development, directly merging back into main via pull requests. The main difference between the two is that GitHub Flow does not have a develop branch and makes use of Github-specific commands such as Pull-requests. This makes it easier to deploy changes to production as there is only one branch to worry about.
