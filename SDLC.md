## Waterfall approach

Waterfall approach includes 6 phases. 

They are:
- Requirements
- System design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

This project management approach differs form others by a comprehensive
documentation and extensive upfront planning. Waterfall methodology minimizes
risk and tends to align well with traditional project management approaches
that depend on detailed records and a clear, predetermined path to follow.

This all is done in the first two phases. The first five steps are done once
for the whole project duration and only the 7th phase, maintenance, is
performed continiously.

Pros:
- Strict budget and time limits

Cons:
- Absence of communication with product consumers
- Absence of flexibility during project realisation
